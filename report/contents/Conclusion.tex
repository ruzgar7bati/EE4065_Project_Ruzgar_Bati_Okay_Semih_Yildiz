\section{Conclusion}

This project shows that useful image processing tasks can be built on low-cost embedded hardware when the logic is kept simple and memory-aware. All three tasks were first verified in Python and then aligned with the embedded implementation using integer-only operations.

Key outcomes are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Histogram thresholding reliably extracts bright objects with a fixed pixel limit.
    \item A lightweight YOLO model detects digits 0, 4, and 7 with strong validation results.
    \item Nearest-neighbor resizing works for both upsampling and downsampling on RGB565 images.
\end{itemize}

Future work includes model quantization for ESP32 deployment and testing under more varied lighting conditions. Overall, the workflow provides a clear and repeatable path from PC validation to embedded execution.
